description: Audit a codebase, path, glob, or branch diff for classic code smells using the 56-smell Luzkan catalog, with detection heuristics tuned to PHP/Laravel and TS/React — sweep nine occurrence lenses, adversarially verify every candidate against the smell's card definition, emit a ranked markdown findings report. Use when the user says "audit for code smells", "code smell audit", "run code-smells-audit", "smell check", "smell-check this diff / this controller / this component", or asks which catalog smells a module, Laravel class, or React component exhibits.

# Code Smells Audit

Catalog-driven smell detection: instead of ad-hoc reviewer memory, findings are
matched against 56 distilled reference cards derived from Marcel Jerzyk's
[Code Smells Catalog](https://codesmells.org/) and verified against each
smell's actual definition before they reach the report.

## Workflow

Four steps, in order: resolve the target, sweep it lens by lens, verify every
candidate against its card, write the ranked report.

### 1. Resolve the target

The argument decides scope:

| Argument | Scope |
|---|---|
| a path | that file or directory, recursively |
| a glob | files matching it |
| `diff` | the current branch's changes: files listed by `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base <default-branch> HEAD)` plus uncommitted changes (`git status --porcelain`) — audit only those files, and only their changed regions when judging severity |
| *(none)* | whole-repo sweep |

Always exclude dependencies and generated code: `vendor/`, `node_modules/`,
lock files, build output, and anything the repo's `.gitignore` ignores. Audit
source, not artifacts.

For a whole-repo sweep, fan out sub-agents by codebase size:

- **Small** (≲100 source files): run the lens passes yourself, sequentially.
- **Medium** (≲1,000): one sub-agent per occurrence lens, each sweeping the
  whole target in parallel.
- **Large**: partition by top-level module or directory, one sub-agent per
  partition running all lens passes; merge candidate lists before verifying.

Each sub-agent gets the target list, this workflow's sweep instructions, and
the index section(s) for the lens or lenses it will sweep — nothing more.

### 2. Sweep — one detection pass per occurrence lens

Read [references/index.md](references/index.md) first. It groups all 56 smells
under the 9 occurrence lenses with a one-line description each — **the index
is the only source of lens membership; never sweep from a remembered smell
list**.

Run one detection pass per lens. Each pass is armed only with that lens's
one-line descriptions and scans the target for code matching any of them.
When code plausibly matches, record a candidate:

```text
candidate: <smell slug> · <file:line-range> · <one-line evidence>
```

Do not read full cards during the sweep — cards are loaded per candidate in
the verify step (progressive disclosure). Do not judge, rank, or filter yet;
the sweep errs toward recall, the verify step supplies precision.

### 3. Verify — adversarially, against the card

Every candidate must survive re-examination before it may enter the report.
For each one:

1. Read the full card at `references/smells/<slug>.md`.
2. Re-read the candidate code as a skeptic: does it actually meet the card's
   definition paragraph and detection heuristics, or is it a near-miss that
   merely trips a surface signal (length, a keyword, a shape)?
3. **Cite the definition**: a surviving finding must quote or closely
   paraphrase the specific sentence of the card's definition the code
   satisfies — that citation becomes the finding's qualification rationale.
   If no sentence of the definition fits, the candidate fails.
4. Drop candidates that fail the definition, **even if the code is ugly** —
   taste is not a criterion, the card is. Dropped candidates never appear in
   the report; keep only a count of them for the report header.

While the card is open, capture what the report needs from it: the obstruction
tag (the middle term of the card's taxonomy line) and the card's suggested
refactorings.

### 4. Report — ranked, durable

Write the findings to a markdown file so audits can be compared over time:
`docs/audits/code-smells-<scope>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` in the audited repo
(create the directory if needed), unless the user names another path.

Order findings by **judged severity/leverage** — blast radius, how squarely
the definition is met, how likely the code is to be touched again. Judge each
finding on its own; **never use the taxonomy as a severity proxy** — lens and
obstruction are tags for sweeping and reading, not ranks. State the ranking
rationale in one line per finding.

Every finding carries all of:

- **Smell** — the card's title
- **Location** — `file:line-range`
- **Why it qualifies** — the rationale from the verify step, citing the
  card's definition
- **Obstruction** — the card's obstruction tag
- **Suggested refactorings** — from the card

Report skeleton:

```markdown
# Code Smells Audit — <scope>, <date>

Target: <resolved target> · Lenses swept: <n> · Candidates: <n> · Dropped in
verify: <n> · Findings: <n>

## 1. <Smell Name> — `path/to/file.php:12-84`

- **Severity/leverage**: <rank rationale, one line>
- **Why it qualifies**: <citation of the card definition + how the code meets it>
- **Obstruction**: <tag>
- **Suggested refactorings**: <names from the card>
- **Card**: references/smells/<slug>.md (in the code-smells-audit skill)
```

After writing the file, summarize the top findings in the session and point at
the artifact. Slicing findings into tickets is out of scope — hand the report
to the user (or `/to-tickets`) instead.

## Reference material

- [references/index.md](references/index.md) — all 56 smells grouped under the
  9 occurrence lenses, one line each; detection passes dispatch from here and
  load full cards only for candidate matches
- `references/smells/<slug>.md` — one card per smell: taxonomy line,
  definition, detection heuristics (agnostic + PHP/Laravel + TS/React),
  example, refactorings, typed related-smell links, aliases
- [references/refactoring-names.md](references/refactoring-names.md) — the
  canonical refactoring vocabulary and the normalization map from upstream's
  103 raw names
- [references/ATTRIBUTION.md](references/ATTRIBUTION.md) — upstream MIT
  notice and the requested academic citation

## Validating the card set

Run after any card edit, batch addition, or upstream re-sync:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-cards.sh            # strict: all 56 cards must exist (ship gate)
bash scripts/validate-cards.sh --partial  # mid-build: missing cards reported as pending
```

Human-readable status goes to stderr; stdout carries a JSON result:

```json
{"pass": true, "mode": "strict", "cards_present": 56, "cards_pending": 0,
 "checks": 2697, "failures": [], "pending": []}
```

Exit 0 on pass, 1 on failure (each failure names the offending file and
reason), 2 on usage errors. The script embeds the 56-slug catalog, the closed
taxonomy vocabularies, and reads canonical refactoring names from
[references/refactoring-names.md](references/refactoring-names.md) — it needs
no network and no upstream clone.
