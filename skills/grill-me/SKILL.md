# Grill Me

Run a `grilling` session on whatever the user brought.

## When you're done

Print the end-of-session block using the frame in [`wayfinder/references/pipeline-end-block.md`](../wayfinder/references/pipeline-end-block.md): whether the plan resolved, the user stopped the grill, or a branch dead-ended.

Pipeline: **decide** → spec → tickets → build   (1 of 4)
Done: <n of m decisions settled; what's still open>
Next:
  • <condition> → /<skill> <ref>
```

Stage-specific **Next** conditions (only those that apply, most likely first):

- **Plan resolved, spans several tickets** → `/to-spec` to record it
- **Plan resolved, fits one session** → `/to-tickets`, or `/implement` if it's genuinely one ticket
- **Resolved but too big for one spec, or still foggy** → `/wayfinder` to chart it as a map
- **A branch is blocked on knowledge someone else holds** → `/to-questionnaire` on that branch
- **A branch is blocked on a fact worth reading for** → `/research` on that question
- **Stopped early** → `/grill-me` to resume; list the open branches by name so the next session starts on the frontier
